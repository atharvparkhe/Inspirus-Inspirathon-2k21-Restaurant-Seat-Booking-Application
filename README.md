## Restaurant Seat Booking System

The basic aim for implementing Restaurant Seat Reservation system is to eliminate the waiting time for the customers at restaurant for waiting for their turn for the service. This system would allow customers to view different restaurants listed on the application, and view the food offered; also reserve seats at any date and time according to their convenience and also pay in advance for the service they which they opted for. The Restaurant owners also get an interface to update the seats reservations and their services, also auto-generate invoice for the customers.
Customer authentication is done using *JWT (JSON Web Token)*. Database used is *SQLite3* which is django's default database. Payment Gateway used is *Razorpay*.
